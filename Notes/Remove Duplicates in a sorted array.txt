Remove duplicates can be done in two ways:

First way: O(n2)

outer loop to loop over the elements
inner loop to check whether the elements are duplicate by comparing with the outer index, if so
set them to some value and then at last delete all this values



Keyword: IJNA

I- i index, J- j index, N- notequal, A- assign

Second way: Efficient way: o(n)

Take two indices:

i=0;
j=1;
run a loop from j=1 to n
check if arr[j]!=arr[i]
if so i++, arr[i]=arr[j]
do the same for the complete array, then return the (i+1) which is the length of the array
without duplicates.

remove elements from the i+1 th to last element, which is ur array without duplicates



For an UNSORTED ARRAY:

First sort the array, then apply the second method.

As sorting takes O(nlogn)(quicksort), so removing duplicates which takes O(n) completely takes O(nlogn)
