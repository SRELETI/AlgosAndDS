Selection Sort:

Keyword: SSMLS

S-selection S-smallest, M-min, L-last S-swap

Logic:

First rum loop from 0 to last element-1.
set first index=min
then run second loop from first loop+1 to length
if jth element less than ith element, then min=jth index
and at last after the completion of first loop, swap ith and minth index elements
iN THAT way, after every iteration, u will get smallest element

Running time: O(n2)
