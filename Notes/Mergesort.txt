Running time:

O(nlogn)

Keyword: MDLCW

M-merge, D-divide and conquer (three steps-divide, conquer, combine), L-length(base case), c-copy, 
W- while loops

Logic:

Two sub routines: one merge_sort, merge

merge_sort:

base case: length of array <=1 return arr
then create two arrays with required sizes, 
copy values into new arrays.
then call functions.

merge:
run while loop check if less than length of two arrays. copy smaller one of two array into result arr
then once exited from while loop, copy remaining elements in the array.


Same running time in all cases



Merge Sort modification:

use insertion sort in the merge sort.

This can be done replacing the base case with insertion sort when the arr.length goes below some threshold.
