Running time

O(n2)

best when sorted
worst when reverse sorted

Keyword: ICKR
I-insertion,C-card,K-key,R-Replace

Logic:

Run loop from second element to last element
Set key as second element
and I as one less than key index
then check if I greater than or equal to zero and arr[i] greater than key
then replace arr[i+1] with arr[i]
and decrease I

At last replace arr[i+1] with key
