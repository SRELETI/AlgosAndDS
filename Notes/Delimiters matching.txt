For Each Switch

Running time: O(n)

Logic:


The string is passed as arguemnt 
then run a loop for the length of the string, take each element and check for conditions

if '[' or '{' or '('--then push into the stack

if ']''}'')' ---- then check if stack is not empty, if so ,then pop an element from the stack 
and check if 

the braces of the popped element and index element are matching, if not mismatch

if the stack is empty, then error, as the closing brace doesnt have a opening brace

all other charcters are handled in default case

then after the for loop is done, if the stack is not empty, then there is error, as there 
are some left over opening braces which dont have a closing brace
