Count of no of comparsions and swaps or copies:


Bubble Sort:

Worst case: Reverse sorted

Comparsions count : N(N-1)/2

Swaps Count: N(N-1)/2;

Selection Sort:

Worstcase: reverse sorted

Comaprsions count: N(n-1)/2

Swaps count: N


Insertion Sort:

Worstcase: Reverse sorted

comparsions count: N(n-1)/2

copies Count: more than n(n-1)/2


but as swaps=3*copies, so copies is more efficient

If array is almost sorted, then Insertion sort is best, because only comparsions are done 
and few copies are done which are not very costly
