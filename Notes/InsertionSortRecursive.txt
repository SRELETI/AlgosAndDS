Running time:

O(n2)

R-recursive, I- Insertion, B-base, I-index, R-return, I- Indexes

Logic:

Replace outer loop with recursive calls.
TO achieve the loop functionality, the recursive call is called with highest index as parameter and the value of the parameter 
is decreased gradually in each call. 

Base case is when index is less than or equal to 1. just return the index in that case.
Then cal the function repeatedly. 
same functionality and at last return index+1.

Insertion sort running time cannot be improved even if the  binary search is used in the inner loop.

in the inner loop, each element is moved towards right to place the present element in the correct place. In Binary search
the correct position is found directly but, even however each element should be pushed to the right. so same thing.
