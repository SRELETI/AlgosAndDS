Horner Rule

Running time O(n)

For evaluating a polynomial 

Keyword:

HRIHX

H-horner, R- rule , I- increasing array, H-Highes index, X- result with x


Logic:

The Logic here is to evaluate the polynomial by substituting the value of x.

So for that, store the value of highest index in result.

Run a  loop from n-1 element to zero.

Multiple the highest index with x and adding the next index.

Do the same for all the indexes. By doing so u are making sure that the highest degree is multiplying
with x degree number of times.
