Parsing Arthemtic 

Two Stage:

First convert infix to postfix
second evaluate postfix

first step:

FES()+-*/op

Logic:

run loop for each element
then switch on that particular element
then cases start
each handles one of the scenario atlast if there are any elements, write them to the output

then step 2:

same FE 
check if the char is operand, thenn push it to the stack.

if the char is an operator, then pop two elements from the stack, then switch to perform operations
and push the result back to the stack.
