progress:

1) Check if a number is multiple of 3:

first: u can use % modulus operator to check it, n%3
second: u can sum the digits in the number, if the sum is a multiple of 3, then the number is a multiple of 3
third: use the binary representation, count of no of set bits and odd and even position, if their diff is zero, then the number is multiple

takes o(logn) time because, the number of bits are logn of the number. and also at each step u are eliminating two binary digits.

2) Efficient way to multiply a number by 7:
